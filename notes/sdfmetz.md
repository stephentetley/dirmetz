# SdfMetz

## Intro

SdfMetz was written by Tiago Alves and Joost Visser around 2004/2005.
Seemingly it was never put on Hackage or made Cabal aware.

The leading system documentation appears to be the tech report:

Tiago Alves and Joost Visser, *Metrication of SDF Grammars.* Technical Report, DI-Research.PURe-05.05.01, Departamento de Inform√°tica, Universidade do Minho, May 2005. 


An archive of some of the Haskell software developed by Tiago Alves, 
Joost Visser and colleagues at the Universidade do Minho is avaiable 
at:
